                    <div class="tabs__content active">Fire Dragons are known for their scorching breath and fiery
                        temperaments. Their scales shimmer with hues
                        of red, orange, and gold, resembling molten lava. They are formidable adversaries, capable of
                        spewing
                        streams of flames and causing widespread destruction with their mere presence.
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabs__content">Ice Dragons inhabit frozen tundras and icy caverns. Their scales are as
                        pale as snow, adorned with
                        frosty patterns that glisten in the sunlight. They breathe blasts of freezing air and unleash
                        blizzards
                        upon their foes. Despite their cold exterior, they possess a graceful and elegant demeanor.
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabs__content">Earth Dragons are massive creatures, covered in rugged scales resembling
                        stone and soil. They dwell deep
                        within the earth, emerging only to protect their territories. Their immense strength allows them
                        to
                        reshape landscapes with ease, and they possess an innate connection to the earth's energies.
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabs__content">Storm Dragons are masters of the skies, with wings spanning vast
                        distances and bodies crackling with
                        electricity. They command the power of thunderstorms and hurricanes, wielding lightning bolts as
                        weapons. Their scales shimmer with iridescence, reflecting the colors of the sky during
                        tumultuous
                        weather.
                    </div>
                    <div class="tabs__content">Shadow Dragons lurk in the darkness, their forms shrouded in mystery and
                        secrecy. They possess the
                        ability to blend seamlessly with shadows, making them nearly invisible to the naked eye. Their
                        eyes
                        gleam with an otherworldly glow, and they are said to possess ancient knowledge of arcane arts
                        and
                        forbidden magic.
